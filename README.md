# node_site
I created this site to learn a bit more about Foundations CSS. I've worked with bootstrap for a few years and decided to try something else. In addition to the confusion of a new front end framework, I decided to use Jade for templating the site. There weren't any fantastic tutorials on using Jade + Foundations, so it was trial and alot of error. Nonetheless, got it done. Hopefully you can take a look (or just clone the site) if your interested in working with Foudnations and Jade on Node.
